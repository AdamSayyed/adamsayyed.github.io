                    <p>I am a <strong>Meyerhoff Scholar</strong> and a junior at the <strong>University of
                            Maryland,
                            Baltimore County
                            (UMBC)</strong>, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in
                        Machine
                        Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I focus on building end-to-end ML systems,
                        designing
                        models, engineering data pipelines, and deploying production-ready solutions across
                        finance,
                        geospatial analytics, and scientific computing. My work combines machine learning
                        research with
                        strong software engineering skills to deliver scalable, reliable, and domain-focused
                        AI systems.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
                    <p>I have gained hands-on experience developing and deploying machine learning solutions
                        through a
                        combination of research and industry internships. At Sandia National Laboratories, I
                        engineered
                        ML pipelines and integrated large language models with geospatial analytics
                        software, improving
                        classification accuracy on field data and creating robust multi-object tracking
                        systems. At
                        UMBC, I designed a multimodal neural architecture for stock-movement prediction,
                        combining
                        time-series financial indicators with transformer-based sentiment embeddings from
                        fine-tuned
                        FinBERT and RoBERTa models. This involved building end-to-end data pipelines,
                        preprocessing,
                        feature engineering, and aligning news sentiment with market data to generate
                        actionable
                        insights.</p>
                    <p>In prior research at the University of Iowa, I implemented and optimized seq2seq
                        transformers for
                        German-English translation, benchmarking performance against state-of-the-art
                        models. At the
                        FDA, I developed interactive R Shiny modules linked to dosing-model computations,
                        including
                        dynamic UI updates, error handling, input validation, and automated reporting.</p>
                    <p>Beyond ML, I have a strong software engineering background, with experience building
                        full-stack
                        applications, scalable backend systems, and low-level architectures in Python,
                        C/C++,
                        JavaScript, and assembly.</p>
